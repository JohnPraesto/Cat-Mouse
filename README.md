A two player game in which one player takes the role of the Cat and tries to catch the other player, the Mouse. Roles are reversed every round. Points are given for successful catches and evasions. First to 5 point wins!

In the microgame Box Series I explore the fucntions of the Thread class to make simultaneous events.
